## 🧱 Scroll Architecture

This is the most critical design decision in the app. Here is a full breakdown.

### The Problem

The screen needs three scroll behaviours to coexist without conflict:

1. A **collapsible header** (search bar + flash sale banner) that scrolls away.
2. A **sticky TabBar** that pins at the top once the header is gone.
3. **Per-tab independent vertical scrolling** for each product grid.
4. **Horizontal swipe** to switch between tabs.

Naively nesting a `PageView` inside a `ListView` causes gesture conflicts — Flutter's gesture arena cannot determine whether a drag belongs to the horizontal swipe or the vertical scroll.

### The Solution: `NestedScrollView` + `TabBarView`

```
Scaffold
├── bottomNavigationBar: _WelcomeCard
└── body: SafeArea
    └── Obx (isLoading / error / ready)
        └── NestedScrollView                   ← outer vertical scroll
            ├── headerSliverBuilder
            │   ├── SliverOverlapAbsorber
            │   │   └── SearchBar + FlashSaleBanner   (collapses)
            │   └── SliverPersistentHeader (pinned)
            │       └── TabBar                 ← sticky tab selector
            └── body: TabBarView               ← horizontal swipe owner
                └── _TabBody × N
                    └── Builder                ← required for context
                        └── CustomRefreshIndicator
                            └── CustomScrollView   ← inner vertical scroll
                                ├── SliverOverlapInjector
                                └── ProductSliverGrid
```

### 1. Horizontal Swipe — `TabBarView`

`TabBarView` is the **sole owner** of horizontal swipe gestures.

- It internally wraps a `PageView`, which claims horizontal drag gestures from Flutter's gesture arena before any vertical recogniser can.
- Both the `TabBar` header and `TabBarView` share one `TabController` (created in `HomeController` using `GetSingleTickerProviderStateMixin`).
- Tapping a tab label and swiping the body both drive the same controller — they are always in sync.
- No custom `GestureDetector` is needed for swiping.

---

### 2. Vertical Scroll — `NestedScrollView` + `CustomScrollView`

| Layer | Widget | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Outer** | `NestedScrollView` | Scrolls the collapsible header off-screen |
| **Sticky** | `SliverPersistentHeader` | Pins the `TabBar` — never scrolls away |
| **Inner** | `CustomScrollView` (one per tab) | Scrolls the product grid independently per tab |

`NestedScrollView` coordinates the outer and inner scroll controllers automatically, forwarding scroll energy between them depending on remaining header extent.

#### The Absorber / Injector Bridge

```dart
// In headerSliverBuilder — records overlap pixels
SliverOverlapAbsorber(
  handle: NestedScrollView.sliverOverlapAbsorberHandleFor(context),
  sliver: SliverToBoxAdapter(child: /* SearchBar + Banner */),
)

// In each tab's CustomScrollView — injects that padding
SliverOverlapInjector(
  handle: NestedScrollView.sliverOverlapAbsorberHandleFor(innerContext),
)
```

Without this pair, the first product card would be hidden behind the pinned `TabBar`.

#### Why `Builder` is Required

```dart
// _TabBody wraps its content in Builder so that:
Builder(
  builder: (innerContext) {  // <-- descendant of NestedScrollView
    // innerContext is used here, NOT the outer context
    SliverOverlapInjector(
      handle: NestedScrollView.sliverOverlapAbsorberHandleFor(innerContext),
    )
  }
)
```

`sliverOverlapAbsorberHandleFor` requires a `BuildContext` that is a **descendant** of `NestedScrollView`. Without `Builder`, Flutter throws an assertion error at runtime.

#### Per-Tab Scroll Position Memory

```dart
CustomScrollView(
  key: PageStorageKey<int>(tabIndex), // Flutter remembers scroll offset per tab
  physics: const AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics(), // enables pull-to-refresh on short lists
)
```

### 3. Trade-offs & Limitations

| Issue | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Diagonal drags** | Flutter's gesture arena lets the horizontal (PageView) and vertical (ScrollView) recognisers compete. Diagonal drags may feel slightly sluggish — inherent platform limitation. |
| **`TabController` recreation** | If the number of product categories changes after a refresh, `TabController` must be disposed and rebuilt. The guard in `HomeController` minimises visible flicker, but a brief re-render is possible. |
| **Pull-to-refresh offset** | `Transform.translate` shifts the list down visually during pull. This can clip the bottom of short lists. An `EdgeInsets` animation approach is cleaner but more verbose. |
| **Full `NestedScrollView` rebuild on search** | `Obx` wraps the entire `NestedScrollView`, so every keystroke triggers a full rebuild. Scoping `Obx` to only the `ProductSliverGrid` would be more efficient at scale. |
| **Client-side search only** | `getProductsForTab()` filters `allProducts` in memory. For large catalogues this should be a debounced API call. |

## 🔌 API

This app uses the free [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

| Endpoint | Usage |
|---|---|
| `GET /products` | Fetch all products for the home grid |
| `GET /products/:id` | Fetch single product for the detail screen |
